For offline evaluation of the MLR model we are working with a dataset that we scraped from the eBay search engine.  The data includes the query term and the items returned against that query.  The dataset also includes the input features we previously used to train the MLR model. In an online search engine the feature vector would be computed in real time for any query. \n",

Before we can apply the MLR model test index we need to make sure the features are normalised using the same range.  That is why the scaling parameters were serialised previously.  In an online search engine this normalisation would be done in realtime. \n",
